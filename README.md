# Transformer
Exploring how transformer models work, and building a chat bot that imitates how I talk.

## What are Transfomers?
A transformer model is a neural network that can track relationships in sequential data, deriving meaning from patterns and context. 

While earlier Neural Network models such as Convolutional Neural Networks required a labeled dataset to train, Transformers are able to find patterns between elements in an unsupervised dataset, removing the time-consuming process of labelling large datasets. 


## What are GPTs?


## First Steps
In order to first learn how GPTs work under the hood, I created my first GPT model following this guide from Andrej Karpathy. Using a list called Tiny Shaekspeare (A compliation of all of Shakespeare's works)
