Exploring how transformer models work, and building a chat bot that imitates how I talk.

## What are Transfomers?
A transformer model is a neural network that can track relationships in sequential data, deriving meaning from patterns and context. 

While earlier Neural Network models such as Convolutional Neural Networks required a labeled dataset to train, Transformers are able to find patterns between elements in an unsupervised dataset, removing the time-consuming process of labelling large datasets.
